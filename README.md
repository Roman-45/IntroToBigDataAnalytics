# 👥 Group 9 – Introduction to Big Data (Python Mini Project)

Welcome to our GitHub repository!

We are **Group 9**, a motivated team of students working together to build Python-based mini projects as part of our coursework in *Intro to Big Data*. Our focus is on writing clean, modular code while applying critical problem-solving skills. We use GitHub to collaborate, track progress, and showcase our work professionally.

# 🧠 Python Mini Project – Powered by Jupyter Notebook

This mini project involved solving two Python problems interactively using **Jupyter Notebook**. We chose this environment for its ease of testing, clean code presentation, and user-friendly interface.

---

## 👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python**: Version 3.x  
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing, running, and documenting code interactively  
- 🔗 **GitHub**: For collaboration, version control, and group submission

## ✅ Question 1: Student Information System

### 🎯 Objective:
To design a simple **student management system** that calculates and displays a student’s average grade based on three predefined marks. The project emphasizes the use of **functions**, **modular structure**, and **formatted output**.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced:
- Function creation and reuse  
- Compile-time data (no user input)  
- Organized print statements for clarity  

### ⚙️ Functional Breakdown:
- `calculate_average(grade1, grade2, grade3)`: Computes the mean of three grades.
- `display_student_info(name, age, g1, g2, g3, average)`: Neatly displays all student details.
- `student_management_system()`: Controls the logic using hardcoded values and calls the two functions above.

### 🔍 What We Learned:
This question helped us understand how to break down a problem into reusable components. It showed us the importance of function-based design when dealing with student or data record systems.

## ✅ Question 2: Palindrome Checker

### 🎯 Objective:
To create a function that checks whether a string entered by the user is a **palindrome** (reads the same backward and forward), while ignoring case and spaces.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced:
- `input()` function for user interaction  
- String cleaning: removing special characters and spaces  
- String comparison and slicing  
- Return values and boolean logic  

### ⚙️ Functional Breakdown:
- `check_palindrome()`: Accepts user input, cleans the string using `.lower()` and `isalnum()`, then checks if the cleaned string equals its reverse using slicing (`[::-1]`).

### 🔍 What We Learned:
This question challenged us to think about **data sanitization** and how **user input** might vary. We also practiced using **conditional statements** and creating user-friendly messages for success and failure scenarios.

## 🤝 Group Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort. All members:
- Participated in planning and writing code  
- Helped debug and test each solution in Jupyter Notebook  
- Contributed ideas during discussions and reviews  
- Made sure code was clean, well-commented, and easy to understand  

We learned not only Python but also how to work better as a team using GitHub and shared tools.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

Through this assignment, we reinforced essential programming practices:
- Writing clean, reusable functions  
- Handling input and output clearly  
- Testing logic in a step-by-step interactive notebook  
- Documenting our work using Markdown and screenshots  

We’re proud of what we’ve learned and shared as **Group 9**!
