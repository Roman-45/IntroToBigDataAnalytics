# 👥 Group 9 – Introduction to Big Data

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Group 9** for our *Introduction to Big Data* course. This repository showcases our collaborative efforts in solving Python-based mini projects using clean, modular code and structured problem-solving techniques. We used **Jupyter Notebook** for code development and **GitHub** for tracking progress, collaboration, and final submission.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of two well-structured Python programs designed and tested in a Jupyter Notebook:

* 🧱 **Question 1: Student Management System**
  A basic student management system that calculates the average of three hardcoded grades and neatly displays student details.

* 🔁 **Question 2: Palindrome Checker**
  A user-interactive program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring any spaces, punctuation, and letter casing.

We used **Jupyter Notebook** due to its friendly interface, instant feedback on code execution, and support for inline documentation and screenshots.

## 👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies Used

* 🐍 **Python 3.x** – Core programming language used
* 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** – Environment for writing and testing code interactively
* 🌐 **GitHub** – For version control, group coordination, and documentation

These tools enabled us to work efficiently, share feedback instantly, and maintain a clean workflow.

## ✅ Question 1: Student Management System

### 🎯 Objective:

To design a student management system using functions that calculates the average of three predefined grades and displays structured student details.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

* Function creation and reuse
* Code modularity
* Clean, formatted output
* Use of hardcoded data (no user input)

### 🔧 Functional Breakdown:

1. `calculate_average(grade1, grade2, grade3)` – Returns the mean of three numbers
2. `display_student_info(name, age, g1, g2, g3, average)` – Displays student information and calculated average
3. `student_management_system()` – Main driver function that provides values and manages flow

This problem taught us how to divide a task into manageable functions for clarity, debugging, and reusability.

## ✅ Question 2: Palindrome Checker

### 🎯 Objective:

To create a program that checks if a string entered by the user is a **palindrome**, ignoring spaces, symbols, and case.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

* Accepting and handling user input
* Data sanitization using `.lower()` and `isalnum()`
* String slicing and conditional logic
* User feedback and return values

### 🔧 Functional Breakdown:

* `check_palindrome()`:

  * Receives string input
  * Cleans it by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase
  * Compares original to its reverse
  * Prints result and returns a boolean

This task helped us reinforce input handling and string manipulation techniques in Python.

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

Our group collaborated throughout the project cycle:

* 🗓️ **Planning:** Discussed requirements and assigned sections
* 💻 **Coding:** Each member contributed functions and logic blocks
* 🤪 **Testing:** Validated code with multiple input scenarios
* 📝 **Documenting:** Wrote this markdown and added screenshots
* 🔁 **Reviewing:** Peer-reviewed each other’s work using GitHub commits

We practiced both technical coding and soft skills like communication and team coordination.

---

## ✅ Tips & Lessons Learned

* Always **modularize** your code – break logic into small, reusable functions
* **Test continuously** in Jupyter – you catch issues faster
* Use `isalnum()` and slicing (`[::-1]`) for clean string checks
* Commit early and often to GitHub to avoid data loss and maintain history
* Comment your code clearly – it helps your team and your future self!

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

This project not only improved our understanding of Python fundamentals but also introduced us to:

* Team-based development
* Structured documentation
* Collaborative coding practices

We are proud of our progress and the results of this assignment. Thank you for reviewing our project.
