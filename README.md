# Group_9_Intro_to_big_data
Group 9 is a dedicated team of students working together to develop Python programs as part of our coursework. Our collaboration emphasizes clean code, problem-solving, and effective use of GitHub for project tracking, collaboration, and submission.

# 🧠 Group Assignment: Python Mini Project using Jupyter Notebook

## 👨‍💻 Environment Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Group Tool**: Collaborative work using Jupyter for code development and testing

## ✅ Question 1: Student Information System

### ✨ Objective:
To create a simple student management system that calculates and displays the average of three grades using Python functions. All inputs are hardcoded (compile-time inputs).

### 🔧 Functional Breakdown:
- **Function 1**: `calculate_average()` takes three grades and returns their average.
- **Function 2**: `display_student_info()` prints student name, age, grades, and average in a formatted way.
- **Main Function**: `student_management_system()` contains the student data and uses the above functions to process and display information.

### 🧾 Summary:
This question helped us understand the importance of modular code using **functions**, and how to manage student records in a structured format.

## ✅ Question 2: Palindrome Checker

### ✨ Objective:
To check whether a user-input string is a **palindrome** (a word or sentence that reads the same backward as forward), while ignoring case and spaces.

### 🔧 Functional Breakdown:
- **Function**: `check_palindrome()` reads input from the user.
- The string is cleaned by:
  - Removing spaces and non-alphanumeric characters.
  - Converting all characters to lowercase.
- It compares the cleaned string with its reversed version.
- Displays whether the input is a palindrome.

### 🧾 Summary:
This task helped us practice:
- **String cleaning and manipulation**
- **Use of loops and conditional statements**
- **Understanding input/output behavior in Jupyter**

## 🤝 Group Collaboration Note:
All team members contributed to writing, testing, and documenting the code. We discussed errors, debugged together, and validated everything by running the programs in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📌 Conclusion:
This exercise helped reinforce the concepts of:
- Writing and calling functions
- Handling user input
- Code readability and modularity
- Testing using Jupyter's interactive environment
